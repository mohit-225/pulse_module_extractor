#  Module Extraction AI – Documentation Analyzer

##  Overview

This project is an **AI-powered documentation analysis tool** that automatically extracts **modules and submodules** from technical documentation websites. It converts unstructured web content into a clean, structured JSON format that is easy to understand, analyze, and reuse.

The tool is designed for real-world documentation such as product help centers, knowledge bases, and technical guides.

---

##  Problem Statement

Modern documentation platforms contain large volumes of unstructured information. Manually analyzing and organizing this content is time-consuming and inefficient.

The goal of this project is to:
- Automatically identify **main documentation modules**
- Extract **submodules** under each module
- Convert unstructured HTML content into **structured JSON data**

---

##  How the System Works

1. Accepts a documentation URL as input  
2. Fetches the webpage content  
3. Cleans unnecessary HTML elements (navigation, footer, scripts, etc.)  
4. Identifies:
   - **Modules** using primary headings  
   - **Submodules** using secondary headings  
5. Outputs the extracted structure in JSON format  

---

##  Key Features

- Automatic extraction of documentation structure  
- Intelligent heading-based parsing  
- Clean and readable JSON output  
- Works on real-world documentation websites  
- Lightweight and easily extensible

##  How to Run the Project

### 1️ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️ Run the Script

```bash
python main.py --url https://wordpress.org/support/
```

##  Sample Output

```json
{
  "source_url": "https://wordpress.org/support/",
  "generated_at": "2025-02-02T12:45:10",
  "modules": [
    {
      "module": "Documentation",
      "submodules": {
        "Installing WordPress": "Step-by-step guide to install WordPress.",
        "Security": "Best practices to secure your WordPress site."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

##  Design Considerations

- HTML heading hierarchy is used to preserve document structure
- Redundant and irrelevant content is filtered out
- Output is optimized for readability and further processing
- Designed to be scalable and easy to extend

---

##  Future Enhancements

- Support for JavaScript-rendered documentation using Playwright
- NLP-based semantic grouping of topics
- Batch processing for multiple URLs
- Web-based visualization dashboard

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical and effective approach to transforming unstructured documentation into structured, machine-readable data. It highlights clean engineering practices, strong problem-solving skills, and real-world applicability.
